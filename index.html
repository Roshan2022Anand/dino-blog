                    <div class="head">Dinosaur (clade Dinosauria)</div>
                    <p class="info">the common name given to a group of reptiles, often very large, that first appeared
                        roughly 245 million years ago (near the beginning of the Middle Triassic Epoch) and thrived
                        worldwide for nearly 180 million years.</p>

                        <p>The name dinosaur comes from the Greek words deinos (“terrible” or “fearfully great”) and
                            sauros (“reptile” or
                            “lizard”). The English anatomist Richard Owen proposed the formal term Dinosauria in 1842 to
                            include three giant extinct
                            animals (Megalosaurus, Iguanodon, and Hylaeosaurus) represented by large fossilized bones
                            that had been unearthed at
                            several locations in southern England during the early part of the 19th century.</p>

                    <p class="info">Before Richard Owen introduced the term Dinosauria in 1842, there was no concept of
                        anything even like a dinosaur. Large
                        fossilized bones quite probably had been observed long before that time, but there is little
                        record—and no existing
                        specimens—of such findings much before 1818. In any case, people could not have been expected to
                        understand what
                        dinosaurs were even if they found their remains.</p>

                        <p>In 1676 Robert Plot of the University of Oxford included, in a work of natural history, a
                            drawing of what was apparently
                            the knee-end of the thighbone of a dinosaur, which he thought might have come from an
                            elephant taken to Britain in Roman
                            times.</p>

                    <p class="info">During the decades that followed Owen’s announcement, many other kinds of dinosaurs
                        were discovered and named in England
                        and Europe: Massospondylus in 1854, Scelidosaurus in 1859, Bothriospondylus in 1875, and
                        Omosaurus in 1877.</p>

                        <p>Popular fascination with the giant reptiles grew, reaching a peak in the 1850s with the first
                            attempts to reconstruct
                            the three animals on which Owen based Dinosauria—Iguanodon, Megalosaurus, and
                            Hylaeosaurus—for the first world
                            exposition, the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London’s Crystal Palace.</p>

                    <p class="info">During the early decades of dinosaur discoveries, little thought was given to their
                        evolutionary ancestry. Not only were
                        the few specimens known unlike any living animal, but they were so different from any other
                        reptiles that it was
                        difficult to discern much about their relationships.</p>

                        <p>Early on it was recognized that, as a group, dinosaurs appear to be most closely allied to
                            crocodilians, though T.H.
                            Huxley had proposed in the 1860s that dinosaurs and birds must have had a very close common
                            ancestor in the distant
                            past.</p>
